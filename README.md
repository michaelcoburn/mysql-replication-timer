MySQL Replication Timer

Script to update master and read back timestamps from slaves to calculate actual replication delay
Michael Coburn, Percona, 2013-12-19
  
How to use:
1. Update database and statsd information first
2. Run one instance of the script against the master to update the timestamps:
3. Run a second instance of the script against each slave to read back timestamps:

 
Assumptions:
* Servers are all running ntpd, otherwise the output will be meaningless
* That you have already created a percona heartbeat table (pt-heartbeat)
* Optional: Statsd is running, and category timing defined

`perl synthetic_slave_lag.pl master update`

`perl synthetic_slave_lag.pl slave monitor`
